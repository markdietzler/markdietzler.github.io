           <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I grew up in Southern California, and after graduating high school, I attended community college for about six quarters. That didn't work out, so I decided to try an automotive tech school in Phoenix, Arizona. That <em>also</em> did not work out, so I enlisted in the United States Navy, which I retired from in 2014. I was in logistics the entire time I was enlisted, working in storerooms doing heavy lifting, and as a consequence I am rated 40% disabled by the VA, so working in that field is no longer physically viable for me. Consequently, I am using the GI Bill to switch careers into what until now has been a hobby: Information Technology.</p>
                <p>I have been building my own desktops since 1996, used nearly every desktop OS Microsoft has ever produced, have dabbled in linux and unix, can put together an adequate web page, and can hum a few bars when it comes to network topogrophy. I hope to learn in college all the underlying theory that I up until now haven't needed to know, and go out into the world and use my skills and experience to make the job of some poor box kicker in a warehouse somewhere in the world easier.</p>
