                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Southern California, and after graduating high school, I did community college for about six quarters. That didn't work out, so I decided to try an automotive tech school in Phoenix, Arizona. That also did not work out, so I enlisted in the United States Navy, which I retired from in 2014 after serving for 20 years. I was in logistics the entire time I was enlisted, and as a consequence I am rated 40% disabled by the VA, so working in that field is no longer viable for me. Consequently, I am using the GI Bill to switch careers into what until now has been a hobby: Information Technology.</p>
                <p>I have been building my own desktops since 1996, used nearly every desktop OS Microsoft has ever produced, have dabbled in linux and unix, can put together an adequate web page, and can hum a few bars when it comes to network topogrophy. I hope to learn in college all the underlying theory that I up until now haven't needed to know, and go out into the world and use my skills and experience to make the job some poor box kicker in a warehouse somewhere in the world easier.</p>
